<title>Mowyw example: page foo1</title>
[% include head2 %]

<h2>foo2 is another sub item of foo</h2>

<p>And now I'm running out of ideas what to write</p>

<p>New style markup (if you don't see anything it means all works fine):
	[% setvar mytest <p>All worked fine!</p> %]</p>
[% readvar mytest %]

</div>

[%menu nav foo foo2%]
